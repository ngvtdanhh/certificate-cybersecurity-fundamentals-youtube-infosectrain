# 🧩 Security Domains Overview – A Foundation for Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is organized into several key domains that define the scope of knowledge, skills, and tools necessary for protecting digital assets.

## 🔐 1. Access Control

- **Goal**: Restrict resource access to authorized users only
- **Key Concepts**: AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting), RBAC, MFA, Least Privilege

## 🌐 2. Network Security

- **Goal**: Secure data in transit across networks
- **Key Tools**: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPN, VLAN segmentation

## 🗃️ 3. Asset Security

- **Goal**: Protect data at rest and in use
- **Practices**: Data classification, encryption, secure disposal

## 🛠️ 4. Security Operations

- **Goal**: Monitor, detect, and respond to threats
- **Includes**: SIEM, SOC workflows, logging, incident response

## 🧪 5. Testing & Assessment

- **Goal**: Evaluate system defenses
- **Examples**: Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, red teaming

## 📌 Summary

Understanding these domains helps in certification prep (e.g., Security+, CISSP) and real-world security design.  
A balanced cybersecurity program will cover **people, processes, and technology** across all domains.
